# Imageboard



**Technologies used:** Vue.js, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, AWS S3 bucket

I built a single page application project in one week during my time in the Full Stack Web Development program. I created an imageboard using Vue.js for the first time. 

On the main page, a user is able to upload a new image and is be able to see previous images posted by other users by clicking on the 'More' button.

In addition, the user has the ability to click on any image, such as the lion cub, where a modal pops up with an enlarged image and the ability to leave a comment.

The Imageboard is also responsive.
